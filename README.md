# SatelliteSimulator
A Java-based desktop application that models 2 co-planar, 0-eccentricity satellites and their movements.

### Requirements
- Java 8 or later

### Some notes
- Some text might get cut off. Refer to the picture above if needed.
- The program doesn't have error handling for inputs. Because of this, make sure you give it numbers.
- When you change the values, first click "Apply changes", then "Start/Restart simulation".
- The code is pretty ugly. I wrote the actual simulation part and then cobbled a GUI around it. However, it works, and that's all I really care about (right now).
